# Frontend & SEO Best Practices

This rule describes how we write modern frontend code and SEO-friendly UIs in this project.
It applies to all code and should guide everyday decisions.

## Code Style and Structure

- **Use TypeScript everywhere**
  - Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes so they can merge and extend.
  - Avoid `enum`; use object maps or union literals instead for better type safety.
- **Prefer functional and declarative patterns**
  - Use plain functions and React function components.
  - Avoid classes in React components and helpers.
- **Keep code small and focused**
  - One component or concern per file when possible.
  - Group related helpers, types, and static data with the component that uses them.
- **Naming**
  - Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs, e.g. `isLoading`, `hasError`, `shouldRender`.
  - Use lowercase-with-dashes for folders, e.g. `components/auth-wizard`.
- **Exports**
  - Prefer named exports for functions and components.
  - Avoid default exports unless interoperability requires it.

## TypeScript & React Components

- **Component definitions**
  - Use React function components with explicit `Props` interfaces.
  - Example:

```ts
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string
  isLoading?: boolean
}

export function PrimaryButton({ label, isLoading }: ButtonProps) {
  // simple, readable JSX
}
```

- **Functions**
  - Use the `function` keyword for shared utilities to benefit from hoisting and readability.
  - Keep functions small; extract helpers instead of nesting complex logic.

## UI, Styling, and Design

- **Tailwind CSS**
  - Use Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing.
  - Follow a mobile-first approach; start from small screens and scale up.
  - Reuse consistent utility patterns to match the design system (spacing, colors, typography).
- **Icons**
  - Use `lucide-react` for icons for a consistent, lightweight icon set.
  - Wrap icons in small presentational components when you reuse them.
- **Accessibility**
  - Always provide `aria-label`, `alt`, and semantic HTML where needed.
  - Prefer `button`, `nav`, `header`, `main`, and similar semantic elements instead of generic `div`s for structure.

## Performance Optimization

- **React performance**
  - Use React hooks and simple state patterns to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
  - Memoize expensive computations and callbacks when they cause real performance issues.
- **Vite usage**
  - Rely on Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
  - Use code splitting and dynamic imports for heavy, non-critical routes and components.
- **Lazy loading**
  - Lazy load non-critical components, modals, and below-the-fold sections.
  - Lazy load images with proper placeholders to improve perceived performance.
- **Images**
  - Prefer modern formats such as WebP when possible.
  - Include width and height (or aspect ratio) to prevent layout shifts.

## SEO Best Practices

- **HTML structure**
  - Use a single `<h1>` per page that clearly describes the main topic.
  - Use logical heading order (`h2`, `h3`, etc.) to structure content.
- **Metadata**
  - Set a descriptive `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` for each page.
  - Use Open Graph and Twitter meta tags on key marketing pages.
- **Content**
  - Use clear, human-readable copy with relevant keywords in headings and body text.
  - Avoid keyword stuffing; focus on helpful, factual content.
- **Links**
  - Use descriptive link text (e.g. “View pricing” instead of “Click here”).
  - Use `rel="nofollow"` or `rel="sponsored"` where appropriate for external links.

## Web Vitals and Monitoring

- **Core Web Vitals**
  - Watch LCP, CLS, and FID (or INP) using Lighthouse or similar tools.
  - Reduce layout shifts by reserving space for dynamic content and images.
  - Keep initial payloads small with code splitting and asset optimization.
- **Ongoing checks**
  - Run performance and SEO audits for major features or pages.
  - Fix clear regressions before merging.

## Code Review Checklist

- **Readability and structure**
  - Is the component small, clear, and easy to follow?
  - Are names descriptive and consistent with the rest of the project?
- **Type safety**
  - Are interfaces used correctly and types narrow enough?
  - Are there any `any` types that can be avoided?
- **Performance**
  - Are we avoiding obvious unnecessary re-renders?
  - Are heavy components and images lazy loaded when possible?
- **SEO and accessibility**
  - Does the page have a clear title, description, and heading structure?
  - Are interactive elements accessible and keyboard friendly?

By following this rule, we keep the frontend fast, maintainable, and search friendly across the whole project.
